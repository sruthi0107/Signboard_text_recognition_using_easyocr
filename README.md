# Signboard Translation from Vernacular Languages

This project consists of a web page built on Flask that takes in the image of a signboard in any language, detects and recognizes the text using EasyOCR built by [Jaided AI](https://github.com/JaidedAI/EasyOCR). The text is then translated to English and displayed on the webpage.

## Quick Start

1) Install all the packages using the command `pip install -r requirements.txt`
2) Run the script using `python Flask_app.py`
3) Open the local host link generated to view the website
